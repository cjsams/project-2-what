			<h1>I never thought I’d like coding, but then...</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought I’d like coding, but then I took a coding class. I did not think I would like it, but then I found out how easy and fun it is be. Initially I was able to pick up on how to write code by looking at examples. Simply knowing how to code was not that exciting although knowing what endless possibilities just simple code could bring got me excited. When I was assigned to do something in class, I found myself finishing what needed to be done and then often playing with a similar code to figure out what else I could do with it. When coding things I wanted like simple games, coding was fun. I really enjoyed typing things out in code then running the code and seeing what I had written come to life; I was amazed with how easy it could be to write a simple yet fun game.
